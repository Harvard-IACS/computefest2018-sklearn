        "We turn our attention to **classification**. Classification tries to predict, which of a small set of classes, a sample in a population belongs to. Mathematically, the aim is to find $y$, a **label** based on knowing a feature vector $\\x$. For instance, consider predicting gender from seeing a person's face, something we do fairly well as humans. To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a bunch of images of people which have been labelled \"male\" or \"female\" (the training set), and have it learn the gender of the person in the image. Then, given a new photo, the algorithm learned returns us the gender of the person in the photo.\n",

After all, in roughly a 10th of the draws, this new sample would be classified as a '0'!

If so, you'll offer me an incentive not to defect. In this scenario, you might want to know which customers are most likely to defect, or even more precisely, which are most likely to respond to incentives.

The final result we desire is not a list of probabilities; but rather a **decision**-making process on how to classify a given sample. The decision risk converts these probabilities into classifications. For example, we make an intuitive decision to classify a sample as a '1' if the probability of the sample being a '1' is greater than 0.5.

This might be a death sentence (not to mention the liability lawsuit). The opposite, predicting cancer for someone who dosent have it (a false positive) is not as bad, obviously. Now the threshold probability for choosing '1' ought to be lower than 0.5, as we ought to be predicting \"cancer\" at even the whiff of it. This is **asymmetric risk**: it turns out that we need to modify the 1-0 risk to account for this *decision making asymmetry*. You'll see this in intermediate Machine learning.
